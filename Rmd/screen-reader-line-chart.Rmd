Attempt to recreate the [Accessible line chart](https://www.highcharts.com/demo/accessible-line) example from the [Highcharts accessibility module](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/accessibility/accessibility-module) documentation as an htmlwidget using [Joshua Kunst](https://jkunst.com/)'s [{highcharter}](https://jkunst.com/highcharter/index.html) R package.

### Notes on the above...

The chart above doesn't use a particularly R-like (or ggplot2-like, which is what {highcharter} is modelled after) syntax. Each group _could_ be defined in the [`hcaes()`](https://jkunst.com/highcharter/reference/hcaes.html) argument, which:

> Define[s] aesthetic mappings. Similar in spirit to `ggplot2::aes`

This gets us pretty close (the code from my first attempt to recreate this chart is included below), but doesn't allow you to _manually_ define the [`dashStyle`](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series.spline.dashStyle) and/or [`marker.symbol`](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series.spline.marker.symbol) for each group (or, at least, I couldn't figure out how to do that). So, in the interest of getting a "dual encoding" (i.e. using both shape/style _and_ colour to distinguish the groups), I added each one as its own series.

### Chart sans dual encoding

You do end up with dual encoding for the marker symbols, you just don't get to decide which is which (which isn't much of a problem, really). There are probably other disparities between the two charts, as I made improvements to the "working" version as I went along and got more familiar with the API.

```{r}
# replace July with proper abbreviation
raw_dat[4,1] <- "Jul 2015"

# turn into "tidy" data format for categories
sr_dat <- raw_dat %>%
  separate(Category, into = c("month", "year")) %>%
  select(-month) %>%
  pivot_longer(!year, names_to = "screen_reader", values_to = "pct_usage") %>%
  mutate(year = parse_number(year)) %>%
  drop_na()

hchart(
  sr_dat,
  "spline",
  hcaes(x = year, y = pct_usage, group = screen_reader),
  accessibility = list(
    enabled = TRUE,
    keyboardNavigation = list(enabled = TRUE),
    linkedDescription = "Line chart demonstrating some accessibility features of Highcharts.
